# Getting started with {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}}

Following are the steps needed to generate, enter and manage keys within {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementservicelong}}.
{: shortdesc}

## Prerequisites
{: #prereqs }

{{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} is available to services and apps that can, with the right authorization, make an API call to {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}}. You will need the following before adding a key.
- [An IBMid and password](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/admin/adminpublic.html#signing-up-for-bluemix){: new_window}
- [An instance of the service](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/services/key-protect/?taxonomyNavigation=apps){: new_window}

## Adding a key
{: #addkey }

Use the following steps to create a new key or upload an existing key.

1. [Log in to the Bluemix console.](https://console.bluemix.net/catalog){: new_window}
2. Hover over the **All Categories** link to make the scroll bar appear. Scroll down to **Services > Security**. A list of your apps and services will display.
3. Double click your **Key Protect** service instance. Note that under **Actions** you can rename or delete the service.

You will automatically be on the **Add a new key** page if you are entering or generating a key for the first time. **Generate New Key** is used to generate a brand-new key in {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} and **Enter Existing Key** is used to enter an existing key into the service.

### Generating a key
{: #genkey }

Use the following steps to have Key Protect generate a new key.

1. Enter the following under **Generate new key** to have Key Protect create a new key.
    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>Field</th>
        <th>Description</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Name</td>
        <td>A human-readable alias to assign to your key. The name can be anything to help you identify the key, such as what the key is used for or who the key is associated with.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Key type</td>
        <td>Defaults to Standard key. A standard key is used as a data encryption key to encrypt your plaintext data to ciphertext.</td>
      </tr>
        <caption style="caption-side:bottom;">Table 1. Description of the Generate new key settings</caption>
    </table>

2. Click the **Generate key** button. Keys are available immediately. New keys are generated by hardware security modules that are located in secure {{site.data.keyword.IBM}} data centers.
3. Copy the reference identifier in the row of the key. The **ID** value is the identifier that you use in the {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} API.

### Entering an existing key
{: #existkey }

Use the following steps to enter an existing key into Key Protect.

1. Enter the following under **Enter existing key**.
    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>Field</th>
        <th>Description</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Name</td>
        <td>A human-readable alias to assign to your key. The name can be anything to help you identify the key, such as what the key is used for or who the key is associated with.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Key type</td>
        <td>Defaults to Standard key. A standard key is used as a data encryption key to encrypt your plaintext data to ciphertext.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Key material</td>
        <td>Key material can be any type of data you want to store in the {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} service, such as a certificate or RSA key.</td>
      </tr>
        <caption style="caption-side:bottom;">Table 2. Description of the Enter existing key settings</caption>
    </table>

2. Click the **Add a new key** button. Keys are available immediately.
3. Copy the reference identifier in the row of the key. The **ID** value is the identifier that you use in the {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} API.

## Managing your keys
{: #managekey }

To see your keys after generating and entering them, follow the steps under [Adding a key](index.html#addkey). You will be on the **Keys** window. Your keys will display in a date-created order with the newest key being at the top of the list.
<table>
      <tr>

        <th>Description</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>

      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>ID</td>
        <td>A unique key ID assigned to your key by Key Protect.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Status</td>
        <td>One of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) key states - Pre-activation, Active,          Deactivated and Destroyed.<td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Created</td>
        <td>Date and time the key was created.</td>
