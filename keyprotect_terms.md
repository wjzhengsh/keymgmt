- **Ciphertext**. Data in its encrypted form. [1]
- **Cryptographic key (key)**. A parameter used in a cryptographic algorithm to, for example, transform plaintext data to ciphertext, or from ciphertext to plaintext data. The key is only known to those services with access to it. [2]
- **Data encryption key (DEK)**. A key that is created by the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} data service to encrypt customer's data when moved into the cloud. It contains encrypted, plaintext data. The DEK may also be referred to as provider-managed encryption.
- **Decryption**. The process of changing ciphertext into plaintext using a cryptographic algorithm and key. [3]  
- **Encryption**. The process of changing plaintext into ciphertext using a cryptographic algorithm and key. [4]

<!-- Comment by Crystal: Providing a definition for IAM roles (and a link to how those roles map to actions in Key Protect) might be more useful here. 
- **{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Identity and Access Management (IAM)**. Helps safeguard your systems, data, and applications from unauthorized access. More information is available under [Security Services ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://www.ibm.com/security/services/identity-and-access-management-services/){: new_window}-->

- **Key destruction**. To remove all traces of the key material so that it cannot be recovered by either physical or electronic means. [5]
- **Plaintext**. Intelligible data that has meaning and can be understood without the application of decryption. [6]
