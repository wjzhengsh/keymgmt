# Troubleshooting

Here are the answers to common troubleshooting questions about using {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementservicefull}}.
{: shortdesc}

## Unable to create or delete keys
{: #unabletomanagekeys}

If you cannot perform {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} actions, verify that you have the correct authorization.

### Symptoms

When you access the {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} user interface, you cannot view the options to add or delete keys.

### Resolving the problem

Verify with your administrator that you are assigned the correct role in the applicable space. For more information about roles, see [Roles and permissions](/docs/services/keymgmt/keyprotect_manage_access.html#roles).

## Convert from beta to general assembly (GA)
{: #ts_planconversion}

Beta users need to change to the standard pricing model to continue to use the {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} service.

### Symptoms

If you are a beta user, you need to change your pricing plan to the tiered pricing model to continue storing keys in {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}}.

### Resolving the problem

The {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} service has two pricing models: lite and graduated tiered. As an administrator, verify that the graduated tiered model has been selected. If you do not want to migrate to the tiered model, ensure that all keys and service instances are removed before deprecation. [See the {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} general assembly announcement for more information ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")]("https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/2016/12/dallas-key-protect-ga/"){: new_window}.

To change the pricing plan:

1. Go to the {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementserviceshort}} user interface and select the **Plans** tab.
2. Select **Graduated Tier Pricing**.
    The breakdown of cost to active keys that are used per month appears in a table. The tiered model calculates pricing based on the number of active keys per month at the account level.
3. To confirm the plan change, click **Save**.
